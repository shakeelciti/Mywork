6. Model Training

Use ML libraries (not Pandas).

Example: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks.

ðŸ‘‰ At this stage, you mostly move from Pandas â†’ NumPy arrays because ML models need numerical data.

7. Model Evaluation

Predictions vs. actual values.

You may bring predictions back into a Pandas DataFrame for easy comparison and analysis.

8. Deployment & Reporting

Pandas helps format results, generate reports, or store outputs in CSV/Excel/Database.

âœ… Summary

Pandas is part of the data preprocessing & analysis steps, not the ML model itself.

It acts as a bridge between raw data and machine learning algorithms.

Without Pandas (or similar tools), preparing data for ML would be very difficult.
